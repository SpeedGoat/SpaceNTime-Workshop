# spaceNtime Workshop

Materials related to space-to-event and time-to-event modeling workshops. The techniques use camera traps to estimate the abundance of wildlife. The spaceNtime package can be found at https://github.com/annam21/spaceNtime.

This repo is still developing, but will include slides, example scripts and a few helper functions written during the workshop to explore choices and assumptions.
